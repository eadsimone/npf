<h5 style="text-align: justify;">NPF Brings Confidence Back To Warehousing And Inventory Management</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Products Fulfilment is Australia’s first choice for streamlined and centralised 3PL logistics. We serve businesses in Direct Marketing, DRTV, and E-Commerce, and we’re dedicated to providing you with the industry’s fastest and most efficient order fulfilment solution. To do this, our advanced warehousing and inventory management systems track your collateral in real time, create automatic notifications when inventory levels fluctuate, and allow us to pick and pack your order within 20 minutes of receipt – guaranteed.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Your Order Fulfilment Should Take Minutes, Not Days</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NPF accepts product shipments of all sizes, stores them in an allocated position within one of our AAA rated warehouse facilities, and records all activity in our Warehouse Management System. Once it’s time to ship, we’ll have it packed and ready to send out within 20 minutes. Plus with NPF’s smart technologies, every item is scanned before packing, eliminating virtually all of the traditional pick and pack errors. And we’re the only order fulfilment company in Australia that guarantees the pick and pack process – if it’s not accurate, it’s free.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Australia’s Safest Warehouses Bring Reliability To 3PL</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter whether your products are entering into our warehouse for a single day or several months, NPF knows that safety and security is your number one priority. That’s why our centrally located <a href="warehousing-sydney-melbourne"><i>warehouses in Sydney and Melbourne</i></a> operate in a strict environment following the principles of APICS – A Society of <a href="supply-chain-services"><i>Supply Chain</i></a> Specialists. Your order is verified and documented before entering our warehouse, and then allocated a tracking number so that you retain real-time visibility over your products. All inventory is guaranteed – if we misplace it, we replace it.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Visibility And Accuracy With Advanced Inventory Management</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NPF tracks and monitors your inventory so that you don’t have to. Beside real-time online access to all warehouse information, you can also feel confident knowing that we provide complete audit trails for all material moves along with carton tracking, serial number tracking date-lot tracking, and advanced cycle counting options. Our business is built around streamlining your order fulfilment, which is why we also handle kitting and integrated management of inventory housed in multiple locations.</p>
